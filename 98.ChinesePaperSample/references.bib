abstract = {Abstract The use of metaheuristic search techniques for the automatic generation of test data has been a burgeoning interest for many researchers in recent years. Previous attempts to automate the test generation process have been limited, having been constrained by the size and complexity of software, and the basic fact that, in general, test data generation is an undecidable problem. Metaheuristic search techniques offer much promise in regard to these problems. Metaheuristic search techniques are high-level frameworks, which utilize heuristics to seek solutions for combinatorial problems at a reasonable computational cost. To date, metaheuristic search techniques have been applied to automate test data generation for structural and functional testing; the testing of grey-box properties, for example safety constraints; and also non-functional properties, such as worst-case execution time. This paper surveys some of the work undertaken in this field, discussing possible new future directions of research for each of its different individual areas.
